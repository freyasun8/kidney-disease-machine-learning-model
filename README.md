# kidney_disease_model
#### Introduction
Technological development, including machine learning, has a huge impact on health through an effective analysis of various chronic diseases for more accurate diagnosis and successful treatment. Kidney disease is a major chronic disease associated with aging, hypertension, and diabetes, affecting people 60 and over. Its major cause is the malfunctioning of the kidney in disposing toxins from the blood. This study analyzes chronic kidney disease using machine learning techniques based on a chronic kidney disease (CKD).
#### Workflow
This work proposes a workflow to predict CKD status based on clinical data, incorporating data prepossessing, a missing value handling method with collaborative filtering and attributes selection. Out of the 11 machine learning methods considered, the extra tree classifier and random forest classifier are shown to result in the highest accuracy and minimal bias to the attributes.
#### Dataset
Given 24 health related attributes taken in 2-month period of 400 patients, using the information of the 158 patients with complete records to predict the outcome (i.e. whether one has chronic kidney disease) of the remaining 242 patients (with missing values in their records).
